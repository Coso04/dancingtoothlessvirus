# Dancing Toothless Virus

A virus based on one of my favourite memes (The Dancing Toothless Meme)

Note: Please keep in mind that this virus can actually destroy your PC, Use a VM or a test PC if you want to run it

# How does it work?
This virus first of all it loads a .bat file that open up a .txt and a .mp4 file then after 50 seconds it loads a .bat file that renames the file "winlogon.exe" into "toothless.exe" and it restarts the PC after 10 seconds and after the restart everytime windows tries to boot it displays a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) because it cannot find winlogon

# Read here if you accidentally opened the virus on your main PC
If you're reading this it means that you accidentally destroyed your PC, don't worry! the fix is very simple.
First of all you need to boot a USB drive on your PC with a Windows installation or a linux live CD
Then you need to go to the drive with windows installed (specifically into Windows\System32)
And finally rename the file "toothless.exe" back into "winlogon.exe" and restart ythe PC
And you're done! windows can boot back into the desktop and you didn't needed to reinstall the OS
